// A boy is walking a long way from school to his home. To make the walk more fun he decides to add up all the numbers of the 
// houses that he passes by during his walk. Unfortunately, not all of the houses have numbers written on them, and on top of 
// that the boy is regularly taking turns to change streets, so the numbers don't appear to him in any particular order.

// At some point during the walk the boy encounters a house with number 0 written on it, which surprises him so much that he 
// stops adding numbers to his total right after seeing that house.

// For the given sequence of houses determine the sum that the boy will get. It is guaranteed that there will always be at least 
// one 0 house on the path.
// For inputArray = [5, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 5, 0, 2], the output should be
// solution(inputArray) = 11.

// The answer was obtained as 5 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 11.
